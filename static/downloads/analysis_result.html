(他微弱的哭聲永遠銘刻在我的腦海裡，成為我記憶中最鮮明、最令人後悔的聲音。) 這句話精煉地表達了作者內心的悔恨和深刻的印象。</p><p>* "And given that I was one of the few people that actually treated him normally, what I ended up doing at that time felt like an act of betrayal to him." (而且，鑒於我是少數幾個真正正常對待他的人之一，我當時的所作所為感覺像是對他的背叛。) 這句話揭示了作者的愧疚感，並將事件的影響提升到人際關係層面。</p><p>* "The faint cries turned into a personal reminder for me, and anytime when someone is being teased, these sounds always remind me that I should stand up for those in need, and prevent another tragedy from happening." (微弱的哭聲變成我個人的提醒，每當有人受欺負時，這些聲音總會提醒我應該挺身而出幫助需要幫助的人，並防止悲劇再次發生。) 這句話展現了作者從錯誤中學習，並將其轉化為積極行動的決心。</p>

<h2>第4部分：文法與用詞錯誤：</h2>
<p>1. 原文：<span class='highlight'>During one afternoon</span>, when I was just minding my own business...</p><p>改進方式：One afternoon, when I was just minding my own business...  或  One afternoon, while I was minding my own business...</p><p>說明： “During one afternoon”略顯冗餘，“One afternoon”或使用”while”更為簡潔自然。</p><p>2. 原文：...I saw one of my classmates being picked on by some other classmates who were constantly <span class='highlight'>disruptive</span>.</p><p>改進方式：...I saw one of my classmates being picked on by some other classmates who were constantly bullying him/her.  或 ...I saw one of my classmates being constantly bullied by some other classmates.</p><p>說明： “disruptive”雖然可以形容行為，但在此處語境中，用“bullying”更直接準確地表達同學被欺負的狀況。</p>


<h2>第5部分：文法、單字替換：</h2>
<p>1. 原文：<span class='highlight'>seldom had I heard</span> about him afterwards.</p><p>建議替換內容：I rarely heard  或 I seldom heard</p><p>簡要說明建議原因： 原句語序為倒裝句，但使用較為正式，可改為更口語化的表達。</p><p>2. 原文：...<span class='highlight'>desperately trying not to attract any attention</span>.</p><p>建議替換內容：...trying desperately to avoid attracting attention.</p><p>簡要說明建議原因： 將副詞“desperately”移到動詞前，使語句更為流暢自然。</p><p>3. 原文：...<span class='highlight'>peer pressure got the best of me</span>...</p><p>建議替換內容：...I succumbed to peer pressure... 或 ...I yielded to peer pressure...</p><p>簡要說明建議原因： “peer pressure got the best of me”雖然常見，但可以改為更正式和精煉的表達方式，例如”succumbed to”或”yielded to”。</p>


<h2>範例文章參考</h2>
<p>The squeak of the classroom chair.  The hushed whispers escalating into taunts.  I remember it all with chilling clarity.  He was hunched over his desk, a small, almost fragile figure amidst the boisterous energy of our class.  My classmates, a pack of wolves in sheep&#x27;s clothing, were circling him, their words like tiny, sharp stones chipping away at his already fragile confidence. I saw it.  I knew it was wrong. But I did nothing.</p><p></p><p>My inaction was a paralysis born not of indifference, but of fear. The fear of becoming the next target. The fear of ridicule.  The fear of disrupting the unspoken social order. So I watched, my pen scratching nervously across the page, the sound a pathetic counterpoint to the rising tide of their cruelty.  The subtle shift in his posture, the way he hunched lower, trying to disappear into the shadows of his own despair – these details are indelibly stamped on my memory.</p><p></p><p>Later, during the composition exam, the faintest sob reached my ears.  A muffled, heartbroken sound that sliced through the silence of focused concentration. I knew it was him.  The weight of my cowardice settled heavily on my chest.  He transferred the following week.  The news was met with shrugs and casual indifference from most, a deafening silence from me.</p><p></p><p>His absence left a void, a gaping hole in the fabric of our classroom.  But it was the void in my conscience that was far more profound.  It wasn&#x27;t just the memory of his quiet suffering, though that remains a searing brand. It was the crushing realization of my complicity. My silence was not neutrality; it was betrayal.  It was a tacit agreement with the bullies, a silent endorsement of their cruelty.</p><p></p><p>The sound of his stifled sobs became a constant echo, a relentless reminder of my failure.  It is a sound that haunts me still, a perpetual summons to action.  Now, whenever I see injustice, those faint cries ring in my ears, spurring me to intervene, to break the cycle of silence, and to ensure that no one else suffers the same agonizing loneliness in the face of unchecked cruelty.  I will never again allow fear to silence my voice.</p><p></p>
